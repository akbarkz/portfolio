# My portfolio website

This project is created using [React + Emotion + Vite (REV) boilerplate](https://github.com/akbarkz/rev-boilerplate).
I also used the following libraries:

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) - to use their grid and some components, like Drawer, Icons, Carousel and Select.
- [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) - for internationalization since this website supports two languages: English and Kazakh.
- [react-modal-image](https://github.com/aautio/react-modal-image) - to be able to enlarge some images.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) - to use pre-push scripts.
